This blog is highly overdue (and a bit long)!

**TL;DR** I discovered programming when I was nearing the end of college. I was very interested in it (almost minored in cs, but it was very difficult to get a space in the classes and I wouldn't have had the time to finish the classes before I graduated anyway). Programming was fun, creative, and I loved the fact that there is always something to learn. I graduated and got a job in business. Programming was always in the back of my mind. After working full time for a year, I decided to make the leap and learn how to code! 

I am loving my experience so far!

### Bit of background on me..

Three things that I would say got me to where I am today are 1) my love for art and creating things, 2) my love for learning in general*, and 3) my love of cultures.

I have always been interested in art and learning new things things since I was a child. If you asked me when I was 7 what I wanted to be when I grew up, little me would have told you "an artist". As I grew up, art was always in and out of my life. I used to draw and craft a lot when I was in elementary school. By the time I was in middle school, my artistic styles changed. I played the flute for two years, I took ceramic classes, and I took some basic drawing classes. I have always been a bit too serious when it came to academic success in school, so by the time I got to high school, most of my time was spent studying for good grades. In the summers though, I was able to learn crocheting and I also took an intro to drawing class. Then in mid-college, I revisited my love for art and started crocheting again (which I still do to this day!). **My overall point here is** that I have loved art and had a passion for creating since I was a kid. However, as much as I enjoy art, I was never "great" at it.

In addition to art, I also had an interest in East Asian cultures since I was a young child. It was something so different from my own culture, but I never really had a chance or took the extra time to learn much about them while growing up. It also didn't help that the towns I grew up in were not very diverse.

When it was time to go to college, I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do in life or what types of careers were even out there. I did not think about art mainly because it was more of a hobby for me and I wanted to keep it that way. However, I knew getting a college degree was important to me. So, I went to university as an 'undecided' major. I eventually decided that, since I didn't know what I wanted to do in life, now was my time to learn about different cultures, experience them, and explore new languages. So, I decided to major in East Asian Languages and Cultures. I enjoyed my major and experience. It gave me the opportunity to learn about the history of other countries, travel and experience different cutlures, and meet a bunch of wonderful people.

\*I don't touch on my love for learning very much above, but I feel throughout my life (probably since the fourth grade), I have been very serious about learning and success academically. After I graduated college, I felt like I wasn't learning enough in the career I was in and something was missing. Don't get me wrong, I learned A LOT in the first few months of working, but I felt like I hit a plataeu after a while. What I like about programming and a career in tech is that technology is always changing. There is always something that you can learn for fun or to better your programming skills. There are tons of languages out there to explore, and although you may be working professionally in one main language, when you get home, you have the resources and knowledge to explore something new.

### Discovering Code

**It was near my senior year of college when I discovered programming.** Sure, I had friends in college who were getting CS degrees, but I didn't take the time to learn what they were actually doing. I ended up discovering code through a club called Web Monkeys. Web Monkeys taught some basic HTML, CSS, etc. I loved this new ablility to create things with code! Because of the club, I decided to explore more into computers, and took an informatics/cs course that was a *"Broad introduction to the nature, capabilities, and limitations of computing. Topics range from the way data is represented and stored, to the way today's computers work, to the general ideas of algorithms and computational efficiency, to the future of computing."* This was one of my favorite courses I took while in college. I got to take apart an old computer, build and program an arduino redbot, and learned new ways of thinking with brain teasers and algorithms. 

But then it was time to graduate college and go out into the real world. I ended up getting a job that was both unrelated to my major and my new found interest in programming. I spent one year focusing on my job, but in the back of my mind, I was reminded of all of the awesome things I learned in college about computers and coding. It was last August (2016) that I decided to officially take the leap. I applied for a scholarship through Kode with Klossy to the Flatiron School's Online Full-Stack Web Development program. While I waited for the results of my application, I enrolled myself in a community college intro to programming course. I eventually heard back that I received a partial scholarship, and I joined the program shortly after that! 

### My Thoughts Now

I am really glad that I decided to take the leap and start learning how to code. It has been about a year since I started my journey, and it only gets more exciting each day. I am so happy that I am able to learn new things every day, challenge myself, and am gaining this new ability to create! I have even started attending local meetups in hopes to become a part of my local tech comminuty. Although it took me a while to discover what I wanted to do, I am thrilled that I am finally in a place where I know what I want to do in life.
