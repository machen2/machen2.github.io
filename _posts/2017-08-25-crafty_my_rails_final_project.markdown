I have always been interested in arts and crafts since I was a kid, so when it came time to think of an app I could create for my Rails Portfolio project, I was set on making a crafting app. "Crafty" is an app in which users can create, manage, and keep a record of any crafts they have created. In addition, user can also view each other's crafts (but only edit thier own) in case they would like to take a stab at trying a new craft! 

When a user creates a craft, they are able to add information such as: title, brief description, set a difficulty level, add a picture, add instructions for how to make that craft, and add different tags associated with that craft. 

Users can view by crafts, tags, "my crafts", and most popular tags. 

(More on the process soon...)
